# Rta

Rta is a mobile-first, AI-assisted code editor designed for Android users who want to work with code, Git repositories, and development workflows directly from their phone. It focuses on accessibility, quick edits, and AI-supported development rather than attempting to replicate a full desktop IDE.

Rta is intended as a practical alternative to complex mobile development setups such as Termux-based workflows, which often require manual configuration and technical setup. The goal is to provide a “ready-to-use” coding environment that works immediately, especially for quick fixes, emergency debugging, and lightweight development tasks on the go.

## Overview

Rta combines a lightweight code editor, Git integration, and AI assistance into a single mobile application. It is designed for developers who need fast access to code and intelligent support without setting up a full development environment.

The application is being built using React Native with Expo, enabling cross-platform mobile development with fast iteration and simplified deployment.

## Core Features

### Code Editor

A mobile-optimized code editor for viewing and editing project files. It supports basic syntax highlighting and file navigation, with a focus on responsiveness and simplicity.

### Git Integration

Rta allows users to connect to Git repositories, clone projects, browse file structures, and manage changes directly from the mobile interface.

### AI Assistance

The app integrates multiple AI APIs to assist with development tasks, including:

* Explaining code sections
* Debugging and error analysis
* Generating boilerplate or helper functions
* Refactoring suggestions and improvements

### Cloud Execution (Future / Premium)

Rta is designed with optional cloud execution capabilities, allowing code to be run in remote environments. This feature is intended for more advanced use cases and is not part of the initial core release.

## Purpose and Motivation

Rta is being built to address the difficulty of mobile-based development workflows, especially those relying on tools like Termux. While powerful, such tools often require manual setup, dependency management, and technical knowledge that can be a barrier for many users.

Rta aims to simplify this experience by providing an instant-use environment for:

* Quick code edits
* Emergency bug fixes
* Viewing and understanding repositories on the go
* Lightweight development tasks without setup overhead

## Development Status

Rta is an ongoing long-term project and is not expected to be fully completed before August 2026. The current focus is on building a stable core experience, with advanced features planned gradually over time.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Editor (Initial Release)

* React Native + Expo setup
* Basic file editor interface
* Local project structure handling
* Simple UI for navigation between files

### Phase 2: Git Integration

* Repository cloning support
* File browsing from Git repos
* Basic commit and push functionality (where feasible on mobile)

### Phase 3: AI Integration

* Integration with AI APIs
* Code explanation feature
* Debugging assistant
* Code generation tools

### Phase 4: Cloud Layer (Advanced)

* Remote execution environment
* Project build and run capabilities
* Authentication and usage limits
* Premium tier infrastructure

### Phase 5: Optimization and Expansion (Post-MVP)

* Performance improvements
* Better editor capabilities
* Plugin or extension system (optional future goal)
* Enhanced collaboration features

## Positioning

Rta is positioned between a code editor and an AI-powered development assistant. It is not intended to replace full desktop IDEs but to complement them by enabling lightweight, mobile-first development workflows.

It focuses on practicality, speed, and accessibility, especially in situations where traditional development environments are unavailable or inconvenient.

## Plan of building

0. Backend - To make the api calls from the frontend we need a backend and a known structure we can build around. Backend is planned to only serve 3 purposes : Authentication , Data logging ( which will eventually be sent to supabase ) and Billing. All database will be at supabase , backend is just the middle layer. Will be built using FastAPI.
 
1. CLI tool - Will provide an insight into how everything will work and will provide a learning base so that the app when built will be easy to work with and will be easy to understand. Will be built using python.

2. Desktop App - After the CLI tool is built and all the learning has been gathered, the project will move onto the desktop app where the CLI tool will get an ui layer and many other features. Will be built upon tauri and preact.js

3. Mobile App - After the desktop app is built and all the learning has been gathered, the project will move onto the mobile app where the desktop app will get an ui layer and many other features. Since all main things will be built before the mobile app, the porting will be rather easy and it will be built very fast. Will be built upon expo and react native.
